# adv_timer_pcb

This is a small project I made for one of my academic courses, I picked a task involving conversion from a THT based PCB to SMT based PCB, for the board I used in conversion I picked
an advanced impulse timer, the THT board can be seen here:

I didn't change mounting technology of components like microcontroller for the sake of comfort since it'd be easier to dismount it in case of any issues or to reprogram it.
